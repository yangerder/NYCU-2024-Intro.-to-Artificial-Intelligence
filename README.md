# Artificial Intelligence Homework Repository

„Äê NYCU 2024 spring Semester „Äëby Professor Èô≥Â•ïÂª∑

This repository contains five homework assignments for **NYCU Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**, covering topics such as **face detection, search algorithms, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs).**

## üìÇ Homework Overview

| Homework | Title | Description |
|----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HW1** | Face Detection (Viola-Jones & Adaboost) | Implement a **Viola-Jones-based face detection** system using **Adaboost** for feature selection. Train models on given datasets and test on new images. |
| **HW2** | Route Finding (Search Algorithms) | Implement various **search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*)** to find paths in a real-world map of **Hsinchu City**. Compare different algorithms in terms of efficiency. |
| **HW3** | Multi-Agent Pac-Man (Adversarial Search) | Develop AI agents for **Pac-Man** using **Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax** search strategies. Improve game-playing performance through evaluation functions. |
| **HW4** | Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning & DQN) | Implement **Q-learning** and **Deep Q Networks (DQN)** in **OpenAI Gym environments (Taxi-v3 & CartPole-v0)** to train agents that optimize long-term rewards. |
| **HW5** | Large Language Models (LLMs & Prompt Engineering) | Experiment with **prompt engineering techniques** to optimize responses from an LLM, analyze model limitations, and explore methods for improving model accuracy. |
